\description{
This dataset comes from the supplementary materials of
\insertCite{Bowling2018;textual}{inconData}.
}
\details{
The dataset is represented as a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}
with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Unique ID for each chord.
\item \code{name}: Chord name (only present for some chords).
\item \code{chord_size}: Number of chord tones.
\item \code{rating_mean}:
Mean consonance rating. Ratings were on a four-point scale,
where high ratings indicated high consonance.
\item \code{rating_sd}: Standard deviation of consonance ratings.
\item \code{rating_se}: Standard error of consonance ratings.
\item \code{fr_chord}: Vector of chord frequencies.
\item \code{pi_chord}: Vector of chord pitches, on MIDI note scale.
\item \code{pi_chord_int}: An integer approximation of \code{pi_chord}.
\item \code{pi_chord_type_int}:
\code{pi_chord_int} but expressed relative to the chord's bass note.
\item \code{tuning_tonic_pc}:
The tonic pitch-class used for defining the just intonation
with which \code{fr_chord} and \code{pi_chord} are expressed.
\item \code{tuning_tonic_pc_int}:
\code{tuning_tonic_pc} but expressed on the same integer scale
as \code{pi_chord_int}.

The table uses representations from the \code{hrep} package.
Loading the \code{hrep} package
improves the way that chord objects are displayed.
